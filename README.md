# Kitchen-Escapades

Kitchen Escapedes is intended to be an online platform for users to share their favourite recipes. 
Now during the initial stages, the recipes have been obtained from http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/. After I have finalised my recipes and taken photos of the dish, I will upload them onto the site. 
Users can click on the name of the dish to be directed to the website for recipe. 
For example, users can click on 'Honey-Lime Grilled Chicken' and they will be directed to "http://www.myrecipes.com/recipe/honey-lime-grilled-chicken"
The next section is on quick recipes. 
There is a google form for users to upload their recipes. Recipes will be vetted by the moderator and I might try cooking some of the more unique dishes. Thereafter, the recipes that people have uploaded will be published on the website. 
The future plan for this website is to introduce a short discussion forum for users to 'rate' the recipes and discuss what they enjoyed about the recipe / upload pictures of their dishes. 
Should users have any questions or additional comments, they can click on the "Contact Me Here" button and send me an email for their enquires.
